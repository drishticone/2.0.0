<p>In June 2015, the 9Apps team sporadically came up with an idea of helping to educate children of the destitute while watching them beg on the streets. In July 2015,this idea bore fruit. The 9Apps with collaboration with Prayaas Welfare Education Society along with the help of millions of mobile internet users donating to Prayaas, with just one click!!!...</p>

<p>Each time you download an application from the fundraiser section of 9Apps, it donates 1 rupee to Prayaas. It&rsquo;s all because of the massive support of the users, now the downloads are higher than the usual and providing a chance to these little ones to unleash the bounds of destitution. It&rsquo;s providing education to the underprivileged and the helping hands they require &nbsp;to edify and motivate the dreams and aims of these little ones!!!.....so go ahead and start downloading for a CAUSE!!!</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">If you can imagine it, you can create it. If you can dream it, you can do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The history of human progress shows that behind every great revolution or innovation, has been a great dream .&nbsp; It is through the &#39;eyes of a dreamer&#39; that men saw the horizons of the future. All men who have achieved great things have been great dreamers. We need to understand that to achieve anything we need to have faith and belief in ourselves and remember that all things are possible for those who &#39;believe&#39;. &nbsp;If one advances confidently in the direction of one&#39;s dreams, and endeavors to live the life which one has imagined, one will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;The scientific wonders which we see today around us, such as mobile phones, computers, LED light&nbsp; etc. all began with a dream , a dream to make the world a better place.&nbsp; It is the fruit of our hard-work and the power of our dreams which leads us to success. Even after failing ten-thousand times Edison didn&#39;t stop chasing his dreams. He is quoted as saying, &quot; If I fail ten-thousand times then I&#39;ve learnt ten-thousand ways in which things won&#39;t work&quot;. Today his invention of the filament lamp diminishes darkness from a large part of the globe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">There are some people who live in a dream world, and there are some who face reality and then there are those who turn one into the other. So no matter what, go after your dreams. Your dreams are your paints, the world is your canvas; believing is the brush that converts your dreams into a masterpiece of reality and as Eleanor Roosevelt put it</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&quot; The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of dreams.&quot;</span></p>

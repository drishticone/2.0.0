<p>&ldquo;Time passes irrevocably&rdquo;-Virgil.</p>

<p>Some four years ago, I was a student of class ninth. More than a boy, I was a kid. It was Tuesday, I remember. All Tuesdays were generally initiated by Physics lecture. Mr. Kamal, our Physics lecturer, entered the classroom and asked me, &ldquo;What is time?&rdquo; Being an obedient student, I stood long, silent. I didn&rsquo;t know the perfect definition. I didn&rsquo;t speak a word.</p>

<p>But today after a long time now I can define time. See how quickly time passed by. Time is the only factor which measures speed of light, which calculates its intensity. Huh? This was Physics.</p>

<p>In the real world, time is the coin of our life. It is the only motionless thing which moves the fastest. It is the only coin we have, and only we can determine how it shall be spent. We should be careful lest we let other people spend it for us. Let me quote Steve Jobs here:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My favourite things in life don&rsquo;t cost money. It is really clear that the most precious resource we have is time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time is intensity. Time is a prose.</p>

<p>To compare time with intensity, I can only say time has power. Time is powerful enough to let me grow from a small child to an adult today. It&#39;s intensity is too high to be comprehended. I still use to recall those days when my friends and me played cricket in the streets. We broke the glass panel, the pots in the verandah. We used to hung around the trees and eat fruits. We were innocent to time and so was it to us. But today, being a grown up, we can not perform these activities. Huh! Such beautiful days that the time snatched from us. I remember studying a poem of Shakespeare lately &#39;Seven Ages of A Man&#39;. He starts this poem in the same sense and divides the life of a man in seven parts. He starts as:</p>

<p>&quot;All the world&rsquo;s a stage,</p>

<p>And all the men and women merely players;</p>

<p>They have their exits and their entrances,</p>

<p>And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>

<p>His acts being seven ages.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus managing the time wisely and comprehending it is very important. Time either makes a man or destroys him. My teacher Mrs. Shashi Dixit used to say,&quot;Child time is all yours and you are the maker. When a child comes and ask you what is time? Tell him,Time is a prose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But how can time be a prose?</p>

<p>She explained that too. Like a prose or a sonnet has rhyme, time too has periodicity. Everyone faces good as well as bad times. Although we generally comprehend it to be immutable, but it fluctuates frequently. Let us consider the example of our Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan. He faced the stardom no other did in the industry. He was at the peak of his career for a decade. As the time passed, he was ruined. His production industry failed, he was in debt and was brought to roads. He did not recover until he managed for some work from Yash Chopra. Chopra gave him a role as aPrincipal to play in &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;. He later was offered to host KBC which finally brought him back to his original position. He was ultimately in a position to repay his debts. Later after 2008, he was the highest income tax payer amongst actors in India. In his own words, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never really been confident about my career at any stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time is a sort of river of passing events. Strong is its current. No sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place. This too shall be swept away. Thus we should value time. It should be understood that the time is a true artist. It remoulds itself in the character which we face. But it isn&rsquo;t as bad as it is considered to be. In the words of John Lennon:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus every moment that we spend, teaches us something or the other. Let us know something. Consider that you are the most depressed person on this earth. You&rsquo;ve lost the love of your life. You&rsquo;ve lost all your wealth. You are jobless. You have nothing! What shall you do now? Suicide! At that time, just keep your hand on your heart. It shall respond-&ldquo;Bloody hell! Go everything, I want to live. I want to see the time ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This incident tells us that we should be courageous enough to face every situation. We should be brave. Fortune favours the brave. We should not probably sit hand in hand and expect everything to be fine sooner or later. It is something as our insights say, we cannot sit idle. Idle without any work. Although time is the best healer, we should be light hearted and stay cool. Stay relaxed. Thus leaving a situation without dealing with its pros and cons is the life lived by either usurpers or failures.</p>

<p>At the last, I would only like to say that we have only one life to live. Everyone has limited time. Every moment we live is precious. Every job we do teaches us something new. It teaches us to comprehend time and help us understand how to live it to the fullest. Thus don&rsquo;t spend time crying. Spend it on what good can happen. Don&rsquo;t spend time beating on the wall, hoping to transform it into a door. Mould it according to the situation and use it to build an entryway.</p>

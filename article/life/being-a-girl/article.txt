<p><span style="font-size:14px">I thought I was fortunate to be born in a land where people worshipped &#39;Durga&#39; and &#39;Shakti&#39; ; where &#39;Laxmi&#39; personifies wealth and &#39;Kali&#39; personifies strength. But little did I know that the society that worshipped &#39;Navdurga&#39; demeans its own women.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">They try to murder me in the womb itself for the want of a boy, forgetting that it is me who has been bestowed with the power of recreation; without me even they wouldn&#39;t have existed. If somehow I survive I am deemed the weaker sex for so long, that it gets imprinted on my subconscious and I start believing the same. If somebody tries to outrage my modesty, questions are asked about how provocatively I was dressed, how could I be out at &#39;that&#39; time of the day; while the culprit roams freely. Someone splashes acid on my face and gets away with it, leaving only scars behind. The scars on my face fade with time, but my life gets scarred forever. My education is considered a waste of money, because I won&#39;t be the breadwinner&nbsp; for the family,&#39; I can&#39;t be&#39;. I am even denied basic facilities like healthcare, nutrition and sanitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">People say I should be given reservation in jobs, educational institutions, governing bodies etc. to empower me, but I don&#39;t want reservations, what I want are equal opportunities. They say laws should be stricter for crimes against women, but what I want is a sense of respect, to be viewed with dignity, not as an object of desire. I want to fly, touch the skies;&nbsp; but remain grounded at the same time. I want to have a voice, be heard; but listen patiently at the same time. I want to go out and conquer the world, without my family fearing for my security; face the heat, the sun without fearing the preying eyes of a predator. I want to turn my dreams into reality without being told &quot; Girls can&#39;t do this&quot;. Some of the greatest changes in this world have been brought about by women. Women who knew no boundaries, who refused to be stopped by roadblocks and who considered challenges as the &#39; stepping stones&#39; to success.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&#39;GIVE ME WHAT I DESERVE, NOTHING MORE THAN THAT; I ASK FOR</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">NOT THE WHOLE WORLD ; BUT THE LAND UNDER MY FEET IS ALL DESIRE&#39;.</span></p>

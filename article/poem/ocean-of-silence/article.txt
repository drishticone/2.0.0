<p><strong><em>Ocean of Silence&hellip;..</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Flowing into the deep ocean of thoughts</em></p>

<p><em>I found an island of silence&hellip;..</em></p>

<p><em>Where there is force, but no violence</em></p>

<p><em>Where darkness creeps, but none to speak</em></p>

<p><em>Amidst the ocean of silence, I saw a melancholy girl</em></p>

<p><em>She looked so pretty sitting under the light</em></p>

<p><em>In her long flowing dress, so pure and so white</em></p>

<p><em>Her face dull and heart screaming inside</em></p>

<p><em>Wrapped in the waves of tradition silently she weeps</em></p>

<p><em>Shackled in custom&rsquo;s chain, yet fire in her eyes</em></p>

<p><em>She has loads to infer but none to hear</em></p>

<p><em>Surrounded by noisy ocean, stifle silence she feels</em></p>

<p><em>Drop of her tears when falls into the ocean of thoughts</em></p>

<p><em>Creates the wave fervently crashing ashore of silence</em></p>

<p><em>Splashes of water, walloping her face</em></p>

<p><em>Smashing her inner soul&rsquo;s grace</em></p>

<p><em>Appeals to scream, appeals to speak</em></p>

<p><em>Before her eventual twilight sleep</em></p>

<p><em>Her heart filled inside with grief of past</em></p>

<p><em>Shatters her inner soul&rsquo;s cast</em></p>

<p><em>Girl who lost her smile in the shuffle of time</em></p>

<p><em>Comes back to life, very much alive</em></p>

<p><em>Her voice was her wings</em></p>

<p><em>Unfettered her from chains and rings</em></p>

<p><em>She walked through the ocean of silence</em></p>

<p><em>To reach up to the heaven&rsquo;s shore</em></p>

<p><em>In deeds, in words, in gestures and of course in spirits.</em></p>

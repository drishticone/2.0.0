<p><em>Dubious deadly borders, restrict my emotion,</em></p>

<p><em>National Service in this cursed place of commotion;</em></p>

<p><em>Couldn&rsquo;t meet you, my dear admirable daughter,</em></p>

<p><em>Here, I stand in dull distant delicate backwaters.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The heavens rejoiced, danced with thrill,</em></p>

<p><em>This day you were born with perfection instilled;</em></p>

<p><em>With Supreme blessings of the holy angels,</em></p>

<p><em>You came to earth to brighten it with candles.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Strong and determined without any flaws,</em></p>

<p><em>And benevolence that everyone will applause;</em></p>

<p><em>Your thoughtful nature makes you versatile,</em></p>

<p><em>Like, each sunny day, wish you always smile.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Wish your days be filled with joyous ecstasies,</em></p>

<p><em>And true come live each one of all fantasies;</em></p>

<p><em>Wish no misery can ever get you hurt,</em></p>

<p><em>And your honor may never have any dirt.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Wish you continue climbing greater heights,</em></p>

<p><em>Just like the ascending high independent kites;</em></p>

<p><em>And can be lead in only a sole focused direction,</em></p>

<p><em>By the string of sympathy, ambition and affection.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Writing this birthday poem, though bit late,</em></p>

<p><em>Sorry, from my heart, keeping frankly straight;</em></p>

<p><em>Wishing you, each day alike a new birthday,</em></p>

<p><em>Happiness and adventure life always portrays.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Nevertheless, I shall be returning quite soon,</em></p>

<p><em>To embrace in arms, my exquisite bright moon;</em></p>

<p><em>Patience that persists for this tricking juncture,</em></p>

<p><em>You,&nbsp;in my vicinity is all that I can picture.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>To watch you run and jump around merrily,</em></p>

<p><em>And hailing, my name makes heart-throb briefly;</em></p>

<p><em>No suffering or tragedy nor deeply seated pain,</em></p>

<p><em>Could ever overshadow, the love we always retained.</em></p>

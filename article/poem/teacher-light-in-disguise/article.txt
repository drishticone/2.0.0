<p><span style="font-size:14px"><em>Horrifying gloom engulfed the soul of passion,<br />
No tone, No trail, No footprint to supervene;<br />
Fear resided within heart, determination distorted,<br />
Not a sole inspirational objective could be foreseen.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><em>A golden spark of illuminance struck the vision&#39;s scope,<br />
Like source of motivation, compassed every advancement;<br />
Stanced up firmly, far-gazed upon the solitary hope,<br />
Followed it, blindly, being carelessly uncalm, impatient.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><em>That bleak light, moulded every inpredictable destiny,<br />
Equipped a coward amateur into fierce battle of existence;<br />
Delivered from uncertain dubious trance to meledious dance,<br />
It&#39;s you, our faith,guidance,rather,life&#39;s inestimable essence.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><em>Alike withered man&#39;s stick, you stood by every spark,<br />
Masculated, every gradual perishing light in dusty dark;&nbsp;<br />
Cherished out profiency towards optimistic inclination,<br />
Entirely accredited to your selfless benevolent dedication.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><em>By and by, Fate splits every incorruptible connection,<br />
You dispensed generous feathers to escalate off aloft;<br />
Yet memories wont perish, with crucial turbulent seasons,<br />
&#39;Cause, you dwell, enclosed, our core angled pretty soft.</em></span></p>

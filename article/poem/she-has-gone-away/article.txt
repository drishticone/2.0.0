<p>The day was 17, the month was June,</p>

<p>when somebody met me in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Litters of love along her feet,</p>

<p>the thing which I trail, for the first meet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a moment, she stood poised,</p>

<p>her heart beats erratically, yet calm was her voice,</p>

<p>&lsquo;something&rsquo; she was saying in the chaos of noise,</p>

<p>But &ldquo;Warmth of her smile&rdquo; was the only thing,</p>

<p>which I rejoice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let, all her tears from my eyes,</p>

<p>&amp; my blessings, just go to her side,</p>

<p>may glories are added, on her every ride,</p>

<p>for her smile, I can strive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her thoughts cluttered my mind,</p>

<p>which always makes me remind,</p>

<p>Why for her,</p>

<p>my &ldquo;Heart&rdquo;, dominates &ldquo;Brain&rdquo;,</p>

<p>&amp; just her eyes in every grain!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, amidst dark crimson clouds &amp; blue light ray,</p>

<p>leaving him alone all along the way,</p>

<p>no reprisals, yet a lot to say,</p>

<p>But in her vein &ldquo;<em><u>SHE HAS GONE AWAY</u></em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the dawn of 26<sup>th</sup> May 2015, our country has witnessed a number of campaigns by our chosen leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a step towards the betterment of our motherland. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, make in India are two such steps. The former primarily focuses on the cleanliness of our society as a whole while the latter called in the industrialists to come and create here. Both of these campaigns gained huge support countrywide and also gained recognition globally. With Bollywood celebrities out on streets with grooms in their hands to global entrepreneur showing remarkable interest in the Indian market, we have seen it all what makes the above mentioned two campaigns successful.</p>

<p>Well, it won&rsquo;t be wrong to say that our Prime Minister has a vision that is a step ahead of our youth. He is no conventional leader; he is no money eater.</p>

<p>&nbsp;15<sup>th</sup> August 2015 witnessed the embark of another such initiative which has the potential of making India a global leader. Our Prime Minister from the middle of red fort, while addressing the nation on the occasion of Independence Day made an announcement that one revolutionary step would be taken pretty soon to encourage the startup wave prevailing the country. He called it Startup India Standup India.</p>

<p>Now 16<sup>th</sup> January this year, this promising initiative was formally launched to give the startups and the budding entrepreneur in our country a better and sorted way of starting up. The event took place in Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi. The launching event was attended by a large but energetic crowd including the top entrepreneurs from India as well as from across the valley.</p>

<p>I would like to pen down my view points over this whole startup wave in our country.</p>

<p>Few among us are of the kind who get really carried away the prevailing socio-economic issues in our society. And if they believe in technology and consider it as a tool which they can utilise for solving the issues, oh! May be they are the entrepreneurs. Starting up is about the that idea. It is that &lsquo;Eureka!&rsquo; moment that comes to those who are looking for a solution rather than complaining about it. Zuckerberg wanted to connect the Harvard, he made Facebook, Larry and Sergey wanted to ease out the process of web search, they made Google. Now Google is for no doubt the biggest, and I meant it, the biggest name you can probably hear. Now what made Google &lsquo;The&rsquo; Google and Facebook &lsquo;the&rsquo; Facebook, is that idea, that sparked in those minds. These guys believed in technology and wished to make most out of it. Sure we know how much of these two things or as I may like to call them &lsquo;internet space&rsquo; has got into our social personal space. Haven&rsquo;t this &lsquo;internet space&rsquo; eased out our life? Yes, I am talking about that. You don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;xyz&rsquo;, google it. Isn&rsquo;t it fascinating how those minds could do so much for the mere connectivity of our world?</p>

<p>These were some examples from the global front. If we look in our country (we don&rsquo;t really need to dig too deep), there is a flood of startups. Want to transit urgently in a city you are standing for the first time? Well, Ola is here. You can get the cab in no time. Now this Ola guy solved a hell lot of problems. Bhavish Aggarwal, CEO &amp; Founder, Ola might have had this idea strike him during one of his own experiences. There are plenty of examples out here in India, success stories. Flipkart, Snapdeal, Paytm from the e-commerce; Ola, OYO, housing.com from the transportation and customer services; Tummykart, Zomato from the food sector, and a lot more. Startups in India are truly easing out our living methods. All of these startups have this one common belief with them that technology can shape human living. When we are technocrats, we know engineering, we can build stuff then we can surely use technology to improvise the human living. In addition to the technology, one needs the strong will to go on as the path of entrepreneurship isn&rsquo;t all smooth as silk. But the one who is not willing to give up is the one who finally makes it to the end. One of the Flipkart co-founder was previously rejected by Facebook two times and the other previously worked with amazon.com, their contemporary before co-founding flipkart. Sachin Bansal, who worked with amazon realised that the e-commerce scene in India is very weak and the brother duo were then driven by this idea while forming flipkart. OYO rooms, it was founded by Ritesh Aggarwal in 2013 when he was just 18 years old. Logically put, he was recruiting people at the age of 18 when the rest of the 18&rsquo;s of that time were probably working hard for the JEE. And of the struggle he put into, he dropped out of his school and didn&rsquo;t tell his parents about it. All of this sacrifice because he wanted to change the way people travel across and choose hotels, because he believed that his idea is worth a risk and somewhat better than the conventional ways. Result, his startup is among the top valued startups in India at present.</p>

<p>Rightly said by our Prime Minister that one who is starting up for money cannot startup or could stay in the race for long. It is not the money which drives the entrepreneurs but the will and heart to change people&rsquo;s lives for the better.</p>

<p>And apart from the tech startups, our country has entertainment based startups too. Two of such who have gained massive popularity based on their social media content are TVF and AIB. And for the TVF, it is worth mentioning that more than half of their creative team including their CEO and founder Arunabh Kumar are IIT Kharagpur alumni. One of their online content titled TVF: Pitchers is also a good depiction of the startup culture in our country. The show was a great success becoming the first Indian TV/Web series to be featured in the IMDb top 200 TV shows with 9.0 rating and bagged the 20<sup>th</sup> position in the list.</p>

<p>Coming back to the startup India movement, I would like to highlight few areas where this initiative would make the difference. During the launching event Prime Minister said and I quote &ldquo;Bas Sarkar beech Mei Na Aye Bohot Kuch Ho Skta Hai&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Few of the schemes under the Startup India movement are-</p>

<p>1.Self certification for labour and environment laws.</p>

<p>2.Conducting and organising an annual nationwide startup meet as Startup India Hub.</p>

<p>3.Launching of online web and mobile app portal which would enable startups to register online in one single day.</p>

<p>4.Fast track mechanism for startups to apply for applications for realisation of the value of their IPR (Intellectual Property Right).</p>

<p>5.Dedicated funding of INR 10,000 crores for innovation and technology driven startups for over a period of 4 years.</p>

<p>6.Tax exemption on capital gains. (Profits one earns from investing his/her own capital into his/her own startup)</p>

<p>7.Income Tax exemption for the initial 3 years.</p>

<p>Now all of the above schemes under the startup India initiative sound really promising and encouraging. Our Govt. understood the problems faced by the startups in the process of starting up and came up with such an enlightening initiative.</p>

<p>Rightly said by one of the entrepreneurs during the event that there is no country in the world other than India working so much for the ease of startups and aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>With such a strong backing, India truly has the potential of taking down the world and be the world leader. What India is proud of is its YP, the Youth Property, as called by our prime minister.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&lsquo;3 idiots&rsquo; is the movie most of you reading this article must have seen with a lot of giggles and self-framed notions at the end. For me, the most fascinating and flabbergasting engineering stuff in the movie was the RC-quadcopter that Amir made. Ever wondered how it can be made or how the drones that are used now-a-days be made? Well, here&rsquo;s a quick guide to a RC (Radio Controlled or Remote Conrolled) Aircraft ;that are actually the modern day &lsquo;drones&rsquo;; which me and my team made in my second year with its upgrade in the coming years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In simple language, a RC aircraft is just a simple small aeroplane that can be controlled by your own hand while in the air. Let us first start with the designing of the aircraft. The main canonical body of the aircraft is called the &lsquo;fuselage&rsquo; which is accompanied by the wings and the tails. The material used in the construction of the aircraft is of very low density. Hard foam or Balsom wood are the best material with the former more preferred than the latter. Foam is easily available, cheap and weary. The fuselage and the wings are taken in a fixed proportion so that the flight is good. The wings contain certain movable &lsquo;elevators&rsquo; on each side controlled by the servos to help elevate the plane during its flight. The tail will have a similar &lsquo;rudder&rsquo; to move the aircraft left and right with the help of servos. The design further depends on the way one wants the thrust to act thus placing the propeller in the right place. Fixing the propellers at the mid back upper side is an intelligent decision. A small landing gear with two wheels can be stuck at the fuselage beneath for better landing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the construction and designing is complete, the main work of connecting the equipment comes into the foray. A propeller made of hard fibre is used to provide the necessary thrust to the aircraft either from the mid back or at the front depending upon your design. They are mounted on a 2000(approx.) rpm powerful brushless motor. The motor is further connected to an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller). The ESC, which is connected to a 2200 Mah LiPo battery on the other side, converts the DC power from the battery to AC current required by the motor to run. An ESC also performs the important task of converting the battery voltage down to 5 V. The battery is connected then to 6 channel receiver with a separate BAT channel for the battery. The receiver connects wirelessly to the transmitter through a 2.3 GHz frequency channel. The two servos are hinged and connected to facilitate the movement of the elevators and the rudder with some appropriate considerable material. They are plugged into channel one and two of the receiver. They are hinged on the wings so that the weight is properly balanced. The most important part by which the aircraft is controlled is a 2.3 GHz 6 channel transmitter. One can control the servos connected to the elevators and the rudders to perform the three basic manoeuvers of &lsquo;yaw&rsquo;, &lsquo;pitch&rsquo; and &lsquo;roll&rsquo;. The speed of the motor is also controlled by the transmitter. Full charge your battery with the help of an adapter and your RC aircraft is all set to fly and rule the sky. Before you set it into the air, a quick check of the wind speed and direction is advisable. The maiden flight really makes you overwhelmingly happy. A quadcopter consists of similar materials with few alterations in design, every equipment used in quantity of four and few more electronic assemblies such as the gyroscope and accelerometer. RC aircraft are used today for various purposes and a little sophistication in design can make them a great profit material.</p>

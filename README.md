##### **DrishtICONe** is the official newsletter of **Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur**. We are a Non-profit organiation created by and for the students of the college under Administrative patronage of the college. Copies of Drishticone Newsletter are delivered to the students on campus and soft copies are mailed to the faculty and alumni.The entire team comprises of students from the institute, and its mission is to report and analyze the events that affect the campus, and to be the voice of the KNIT Sultanpur student community by being the media force. Besides, we also organize social activities like Blood donation camp every year and King George's Medical University,Lucknow has credited us the star performers in saving mankind. Drishticone surely lives upto its nickname "D Icon". It is a moment of pride to see that amongst all the other government colleges of Uttar Pradesh, KNIT Sultanpur is one of the few colleges having a newsletter of it's own.
